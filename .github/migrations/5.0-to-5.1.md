# ASF V5.0 -> V5.1

## Plugins

### `SelectElementNodes(...)`, `SelectNodes(...)`

Previously returned `List<IElement>`, now returns `IEnumerable<IElement>`

https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/commit/65dc5def01b4208dd019685c8724d88f82d2902f

#### Proper solution

Use `IEnumerable<IElement>` where you've previously used `List<IElement>`. If you're just enumerating over results, you don't need a full collection, we didn't need it anywhere in ASF code when doing this change.

#### Alternative solution

Just call `.ToList()` on the result yourself.
